Welcome to the "A Global Analysis of Coral Reef Bleachings" project, an interactive exploration of coral reef health and the factors contributing to bleaching events worldwide. This project aims to answer key questions about the extent, causes, and geographical distribution of coral reef bleachings. By analyzing and visualizing relevant data, we strive to deepen our understanding of these critical marine ecosystems and raise awareness for their conservation.
